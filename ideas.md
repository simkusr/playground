# Prepare my laptop for linux kernel coding.

As I'm planning to start open source contributioning on linux kernel, I need a proper machine that works properly and has ability to be moved from one place to another without worrying of battery life (now is dead). As I do not wan't to spend tremendous amount of money I will fix this one and prepare it properly to be used for kernel contributioning until I will make enough money to buy lenovo thinkpad P series good laptop which might cost from 2500 euros to 6000 euros.

1. Remove dust, cleanup and change thermal paste
2. Change battery to a new one
3. Cleanly setup debian on laptop
4. setup everything properly, vmbox and etc
