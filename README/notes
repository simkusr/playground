read kernel docs https://docs.kernel.org to undesrand about process of deve-
lopment and other details about kernel before jumping on it.

maybe reading free ebook about git would also give more knowledge
and ease of mind regarding kernel dev

# notes from kernel docs

- major release happens every 2-3 months
- the merge window for new features lasts up to 2 weeks and after x.x.x-rc1
the time is to stabilize the rc (release candidate)
- over next 6-10 weeks only fix patches are accepted to the mainline,
unless some times if it's e.g. driver code that doesn't touch in-tree code
then it might be accepted like new feature, but very reare it is.
